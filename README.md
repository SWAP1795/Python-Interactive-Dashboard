# Steps to View Dashboard
Install required python libraries:
pip install panel
pip install hvplot
To launch the dashboard, after you finished coding, use following command in Jupyter Lab terminal:
"panel serve Python_Visual.ipynb"
Note: The dashboard may take several minutes to load the graphs and also if you want to make changes to the dashboard/graphs, you will have to close the entire Jupyter Lab and relaunch it again to see the changes, after you modified the code.
