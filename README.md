# Steps to View Dashboard
# 1. Install required Python libraries:
` pip install panel `  
` pip install hvplot `
# 2. To launch the dashboard, after you finish coding, use the following command in the Jupyter Lab terminal:
` panel serve Python_Visual.ipynb `  
Note: The dashboard may take several minutes to load the graphs and also if you want to make changes to the dashboard/graphs, you will have to close the entire Jupyter Lab and relaunch it to see the changes, after you modify the code.
